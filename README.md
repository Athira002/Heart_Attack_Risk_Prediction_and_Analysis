# Heart_Attack_Risk_Prediction_and_Analysis

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart attacks, are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and the burden is rapidly increasing in developing countries like India. With changing lifestyles, urbanization, and increased exposure to risk factors such as smoking, poor diet, stress, diabetes, and hypertension, the Indian population has become increasingly vulnerable to heart-related conditions. Despite this, early detection and prevention strategies often remain underutilized due to a lack of personalized, data-driven risk assessments.

This project focuses on predicting heart attack risk and identifying key contributing factors using data from the Indian population. By applying statistical techniques and machine learning models, the aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that can help in early intervention and better risk stratification. The study explores clinical parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status, and lifestyle attributes such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. It also investigates regional disparities by incorporating demographic variables such as state of residence and access to healthcare.

The motivation behind this project lies in developing a data-informed approach that not only aids in individual risk prediction but also informs public health policies. By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and classification models, this study strives to provide a holistic view of heart attack risk factors prevalent in India. The outcomes can support clinicians in understanding high-risk profiles and empower individuals to make informed health decisions. For more details see Prabhakaran et al.(2016).
