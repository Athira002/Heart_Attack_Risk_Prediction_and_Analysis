## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart attacks, are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and the burden is rapidly increasing in developing countries like India. With changing lifestyles, urbanization, and increased exposure to risk factors such as smoking, poor diet, stress, diabetes, and hypertension, the Indian population has become increasingly vulnerable to heart-related conditions. Despite this, early detection and prevention strategies often remain underutilized due to a lack of personalized, data-driven risk assessments.

This project focuses on predicting heart attack risk and identifying key contributing factors using data from the Indian population. By applying statistical techniques and machine learning models, the aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that can help in early intervention and better risk stratification. The study explores clinical parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status, and lifestyle attributes such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. It also investigates regional disparities by incorporating demographic variables such as state of residence and access to healthcare.

The motivation behind this project lies in developing a data-informed approach that not only aids in individual risk prediction but also informs public health policies. By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and classification models, this study strives to provide a holistic view of heart attack risk factors prevalent in India. The outcomes can support clinicians in understanding high-risk profiles and empower individuals to make informed health decisions. For more details see Prabhakaran et al.(2016).

## Objectives of the Study
1. To identify and analyze key clinical and lifestyle factors (such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, stress, and smoking) associated with heart attack risk in the Indian population.

2. To perform statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., chi-square tests, logistic regression, ANOVA) to determine significant predictors of heart attack occurrence.
    
3. To build and evaluate predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) for estimating the likelihood of heart attacks using structured health data.

4. To explore geographical and demographic variations in heart attack risk across different Indian states and age groups.

## About Dataset
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in India, with heart attacks (myocardial infarctions) accounting for a significant portion. India has a higher heart disease burden than many other nations, with cases occurring at younger ages compared to Western countries. This dataset incorporates key medical and lifestyle risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, air pollution exposure, and healthcare access. 

## Summary
Using a dataset representative of the Indian population, this project carried out end-to-end analysis and prediction of heart attack risk. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation, it was found that factors such as age, diabetes, LDL levels, blood pressure, and stress have a significant impact on risk levels.

Machine learning models were compared, and Logistic Regression with balanced class weights showed interpretable results, while Random Forests  were used for deeper insight. Clustering analysis revealed natural risk groups among patients, emphasizing the role of unsupervised learning in medical profiling.

Overall, this study provides a robust framework for heart attack risk prediction, highlighting the importance of preventive care in the Indian context.
